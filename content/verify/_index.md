The Verify API enables you to confirm that you can contact a user at a specific number, so that you can:

- Reach your users at any time, by ensuring that you have their correct phone number
- Protect against fraud and spam, by preventing one user from creating multiple accounts
- Add an extra layer of security to help confirm a user's identity when they want to perform certain activities
