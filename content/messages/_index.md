> NB: The SMS' you sent earlier (via CLI and direct API call) were sent via the Vonage SMS API and don't require dedicated setup.

## Supported Features

A full list of supported features is available on the Developer Portal [Messages Overview page](https://developer.vonage.com/messages/overview#supported-features).

## Interface

The Messages section consists of one screen that shows a form to send a message:
